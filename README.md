Project Abstract:
Phytophthora Infestans, generally referred to as potato blight, is a widespread, highly infectious pathogenic disease among potato plants. Without immediate removal upon identification, its consequences on produce health are devastating. An average annual damage of $6.7 billion necessitates manual, systematic inspections for farmers, however, this process is labor-intensive and unsustainable. With current automated solutions being negligible, the implementation of an innovative, autonomous solution for potato blight management is crucial. Hence, a multi-faceted approach utilizing machine learning algorithms, robotic automation, and mapping is developed. A robot utilizes a compact caterpillar drivetrain to navigate through rough, narrow, outdoor terrain. To accurately identify instances of blight, a USB Webcam is attached, passing its image input through two machine learning algorithms. The first is an object detection algorithm that locates individual potato leaves. Each respective leaf is subsequently passed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that identifies blight. Model optimization techniques including data augmentation resulted in a CNN accuracy of 99.88%. To store locations at which blight is present, a human-readable map of the crop rows is generated, highlighting blight-affected plants. Farmers are provided with updates of their crops' health via periodic, autonomous emails. A physical farm was simulated through strategically placed images containing healthy and blight-infected plants in order to evaluate performance. The robot was successfully able to identify every instance of blight through multiple trials. These promising results indicate that repurposing this technology to combat a variety of plant diseases is a feasible approach in working towards universal crop-security.
